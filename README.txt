A super lightweight divi plugin that extends Divi with exclusives custom responsive options for mobile and tablet.

== Description ==

At **Divi Candy** we think Divi is the best WordPress theme. This is why our divi plugins extend the Divi Builder capabilities to make it even greater.

Our first plugin is **Responsive Divi Candy**, a super lightweight plugin that helps you master rows & columns layouts with Divi. Fully compatible with the last version of the Divi Builder.

# üìå How it works

First, activate the wordpress plugin (no other configuration needed!). It will integrate directly into the Divi Builder.

= Choose the number of Columns =
With Divi you cannot choose if you want to have two, three or four columns side-by-side on mobile or tablet... Not anymore! You can now choose the number of columns that stack side-by-side on mobile and tablet directly into the Divi Builder.

1. Open up your Divi Builder and edit a Row. Go to the Advanced tab in the Rows Settings.
2. Toggle the option "CSS ID & Classes".
3. Here you will see two new options called **Number of Columns on Tablet** and **Number of Columns on Mobile**.
4. You can now choose from the dropdown list how many columns do you want to have on mobile and tablet.
5. **That's all**. Congratulations!

= Set Column stacking order =
With Divi you cannot choose if you want to change the column stacking order on mobile or tablet... Not anymore! You can now choose which column will be the first and which one will be the second on mobile and tablet. No need to change your design layout or duplicate it just for mobile and tablet directly into the Divi Builder.

1. Open up your Divi Builder and edit a Row. Go to the Advanced tab in the Rows Settings.
2. Toggle the option "CSS ID & Classes".
3. Here you will see two new options called **Stacking Order on Tablet** and **Stacking Order on Mobile**. You can choose to activate just for Tablets or Mobiles or both.
4. After that, go to the Content tab in the Rows Settings, and go inside the first Colums Settings by clicking the gear icon.
5. Go to the Advanced tab in the Columns Settings.
6. Toggle the option "CSS ID & Classes".
7. Here you will see two new options called **Stacking Order on Tablet** and **Stacking Order on Mobile**.
8. You can now choose from the dropdown list the stacking order (from 1 to 6) on mobile and tablet.
9. You need to assign an order to EACH column!
10. **That's all**. Congratulations!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How this plugin really works? =

Responsive Divi Candy is a really simple divi plugin. Once you select an option of the plugin, Responsive Divi Candy will add one CSS class to the **CSS Class** field inside the "CSS ID & Classes" options in the "Advanced tab" of the Divi Builder.

If by accident, you delete this CSS class, you can just select again the same option and Responsive Divi Candy will add the correct CSS class again.

The plugin will add a single line of CSS to the page output, so yes, really lightweight.
